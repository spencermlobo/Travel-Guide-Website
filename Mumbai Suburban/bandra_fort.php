      <h2>INFORMATION</h2>
      <h3>
      Castella de Aguada, also known as the Bandra Fort, is a fort located in Bandra, Mumbai. "Castella" is a misspelling for Portuguese "Castelo", although it seems its Portuguese builders actually called it Forte de Bandor√°. It is located at Land's End in Bandra. It was built by the Portuguese in 1640 as a watchtower overlooking Mahim Bay, the Arabian Sea and the southern island of Mahim. The strategic value of the fort was enhanced in 1661 after the Portuguese ceded the seven islands of Bombay that lay to the immediate south of Bandra to the English. The name indicates its origin as a place where fresh water was available in the form of a fountain for Portuguese ships cruising the coasts in the initial period of Portuguese presence. The fort lies over several levels, from sea level to an altitude of 24 metres. Castella de Aguada has been featured in several Hindi films, such as Dil Chahta Hai and Buddha Mil Gaya. 
      It was built by the Portuguese in the year 1640 as a watchtower overlooking the Mahim Bay, the Arabian Sea and the southern island of Mahim after defeating Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. The fort was partially destroyed by the Britishers after the decline of the Portuguese in the 18th century as a precautionary measure. The demolition was to nullify the possibility of the fort being captured by the Marathas, with the possibility of it being used as a forward military base to attack British Bombay.
