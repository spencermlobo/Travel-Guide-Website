      <h2>INFORMATION</h2>
      <h3>
      The Rajarajeswara temple is a Shiva temple located in Taliparamba in Kannur district of Kerala, South India. It was built by Raja Raja Chola I. The temple is regarded as one of the existing 108 ancient Shiva Temples of ancient Kerala. It also has a prominent place amongst the numerous Shiva temples in South India. It had the tallest shikhara amongst the temples of its time. The Rajarajeshwara temple has a top of about 90 tonnes. If any problem is encountered in the other temples of South India, devotees seek a solution in this temple through a prasna, a traditional method of astrological decision making.[citation needed] The prasna is conducted on a peedha (a raised platform) outside the temple.
      Legendarily, it was supposedly renovated by Sage Parashurama, long before the Kali Yuga commenced. Several centuries ago it was renovated by the Mushika (Kolathiri) dynasty kings. This temple was rebuilt into its present form in the early eleventh century. The quadrangular sanctum has a two-tiered pyramidal roof; in front of the sanctum is the namaskara mandapam, but the temple has no kodi maram (flagstaff), unlike others in Kerala. Only Hindus are permitted to enter.
      One of the oldest temple in Akola, Rajeshwar Mandir, also known as Rajeshwar Nagari, is located in the famous Akola Fort. Linga in the temple has a little crack. The reason behind the crack is a story, which took place during the reign of King Akola Singh. It is said that King Akola Singh's wife used to go out in the midnight for illicit reasons. So one day King Akola Singh followed her. Seeing the king stalking, she went straight to a Shiva temple and pleaded to the god that her husband is not keeping faith and loyalty to her. She then requested lord Shiva to convert her into a lingam. Later, the lingam broke into two parts and she jumped into it. People from all walks of life visit the temple during Monday as it is considered as auspicious.
