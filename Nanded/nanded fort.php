      <h2>INFORMATION</h2>
      <h3>Nanded Fort is a historical structure and a fort located in Nanded. It is quite close to Nanded city center at a distance of 2. 5 km from it. Nanded Fort is located beside the River Godavari and is enclosed by it on three sides. Located on the Qilla Road in the Marathwada region, the Nanded Fort was built by the Nanda dynasty in the 6th century. The Fort was made so as to serves as a lookout in case of invasion from enemies and to save the people of Nanded from repeated conquests. The Fort is situated on a hill and it overlooks the countryside giving it strategic importance. The Fort was once quite impregnable. The fort is in ruins due to repeated vandalisation by the Mughals. It is made out of solid stones and hardened wood studded with nails. The roof of the Fort is lined with positions for archers. There are also many passages for the smooth movement of troops. Inside the Fort, there is a large courtyard with many graceful archways. The archways are constructed in the typical Indian style with notably some Buddhist influences. The archways lead to many staircases leading to various parts of the Fort. The Fort is located in an enchanting place with many sprawling gardens surrounding it. There are also many stone rooms for storage of arms and rations during a siege. There is a water tank similar to the one found in Mohenjo Daro with stone steps leading to it which suggests that there was some connection between ancient India and the Harappan civilisation. This tank also supplied water for local irrigation practices resulting in bountiful harvests recorded in many historical texts such as the Leela Charitra. So, the architects who constructed this Fort had kept everything in mind with even undeground passages for the safe escape of the King. Later, this tank was repaired by the Nizam government and it still fulfills the drinking needs of the city. There are four bastions and a cannon. The local muncipality or the NWCMC has invested a lot on its upkeep and also started construction of a museum to show the rich history of the Fort.
The Fort is extremely popular with history buffs. Even if the fort is in ruins many people still go to visit it. It is a very popular leisure spot among locals who spend their time sitting at the ruins and watching the sunset. Although most of the ruins are off limits to the tourists you can still watch the sunset from a quiet place. Also, the flow of the Godavari is very mesmerising. It is best to visit the place during winters from October - January as the stones can get very hot.
Nanded Fort finds immense importance due to its unique position in history. . It is visited by architecture lovers and those with a passion for photography. There are large swathes of agricultural lands surrounding it, which turn green after the monsoons making it a really beautiful photogenic experience. There Fort remains open throughout the day, usually with timings 9:00 AM - 7:00 PM. There are no entry fees for visiting this Fort.
