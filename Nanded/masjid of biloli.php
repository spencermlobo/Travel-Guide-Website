      <h2>INFORMATION</h2>
      <h3>Masjid Of Biloli is located in Biloli Town on the Nanded - Narsi Highway and is at a distance of 68 kms from Nanded.The Masjid of Biloli is locally known as the Hazrat Nawab Sarfaraz Khan Sahid Masjid. It is said to have been constructed about 330 years back by Sarfaraz Khan. He was an officer in the army of Aurangzeb. The Masjid is an architectural beauty and has Islamic influence. There are four minarets, from where prayers are held on the southern side . These minarets collapsed when it was hit by a lightening in 1960 but was later restored by the Government. The one on the north has eight chains. Below the chains is a figure in the shape of a bell. The tops of the minarets are made with some alloy, probably brass and is in a half crescent shape. To the north-west corner of the Masjid is a square shaped well called a barrow. The barrow serves as a water source and it supplies water for the day to day functioning of the Masjid. It also plays an important role during the breaking of fast or roza. There are numerous steps leading to the well. There is beautiful Belgian glass lining the windows of the Masjid. There is also a central spacious courtyard where numerous pigeons are found when namaaz is not held. There are inscriptions in Urdu made out of marble and granite, testimony to the skill of the workers. The arches have delicate jaali work which help in screening. There are also numerous graceful arches which serve as a gateway to the courtyard. There are rich designs on the roof of the Masjid. The roof is supported by stone ledges which are overhanging yet is balanced. The devotees can ecircle the entire Majid which is now lined with steel railings . The Hindu influences can be seen by a many petalled flowers carving on the wall of the Masjid which is a deviation from the geometric and abstract Islamic motifs.
The Masjid of Biloli is worth a visit by all devout Muslims as well as those who aprreciate splendid architecture. Visitors to the Masjid will love its spacious courtyards where namaaz prayers are held during the holy months of Ramzan. During the holy months of Ramzan the Masjid the Masjid is thoroughly spruced up. Even the guards and the caretakers are very friendly and accomodating.
