This religious place Hazur Sahib is also called Takht Sachkhand Sri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib. This is one of the five major akal takhts in Sikhism. Within the complex there is a 'Gurudwara' which is also known as 'Sach Khand', which means 'A Region of Truth'. The inner room of the Gurudwara is known as 'Angitha Sahib' and Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated here at 1708. In the last decade of his ruling time, Maharaja Ranjit Singh built this great place. This was built between 1832 to 1837. This place bears an interesting and sad history of the death of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. In 1708, Guru Gobind Singh Ji has his camp here. He was attacked by two assassins. One of the attackers stabbed the Guruji. This attacker was killed by a single stroke of Guruji's Talwar. The second attacker was killed by Guruji's followers when he tried to escape. However, an English doctor treated and stitched the wound of Guruji. Though after some time, it became much more dangerous and Guruji died of it after declaring Guru Granth Sahib Ji as his successor. The Sikhs built a room where Guru Gobind Singh Ji would sit and installed Guru Granth Sahib in it. 300th anniversary of Guru Granth Sahib took place here in 2008. This marvelous huge complex of Gurudwara at Hazur Sahib is carrying this history in every pillar of it. This shrine has a difference from other four akal takhts of Sikh worship.
