      <h2>INFORMATION</h2>
      <h3>
      Trimbakeshwar Simhastha is a Hindu religious mela held every 12 years
in the Nashik district of Maharashtra, India. The name of the festival is also transliterated
 as Sinhastha or Singhastha. It is one of the four fairs traditionally recognized as Kumbha 
Melas, and is also known as Nashik-Trimbak Kumbha Mela or Nashik Kumbha Mela.
Kumbh Mela or Kumbha Mela is a major pilgrimage and festival in Hinduism.
It is celebrated in a cycle of approximately 12 years, to celebrate every revolution 
Brihaspati (Jupiter) completes, at four river-bank pilgrimage sites: the Allahabad (Prayagraj) 
(Ganges-Yamuna-Sarasvati rivers confluence), Haridwar (Ganges), Nashik (Godavari), and 
Ujjain (Shipra).The festival is marked by a ritual dip in the waters, but it is also a celebration
 of community commerce with numerous fairs, education, religious discourses by saints, 
mass feedings of monks or the poor, and entertainment spectacle.The seekers believe 
that bathing in these rivers is a means to prāyaścitta (atonement, penance) for past mistakes,
and that it cleanses them of their sins.The festival is traditionally credited to the 8th-century 
Hindu philosopher and saint Adi Shankara, as a part of his efforts to start major Hindu gatherings
 for philosophical discussions and debates along with Hindu monasteries across the Indian 
subcontinent.However, there is no historical literary evidence of these mass pilgrimages 
called "Kumbha Mela" prior to the 19th century. There is ample evidence in historical manuscripts
 and inscriptions of an annual Magha Mela in Hinduism – with periodic larger gatherings after 
6 or 12 years – where pilgrims gathered in massive numbers and where one of the rituals included
 a sacred dip in a river or holy tank. According to Kama MacLean, the socio-political developments 
during the colonial era and a reaction to Orientalism led to the rebranding and remobilisation of the
 ancient Magha Mela as the modern era Kumbh Mela, particularly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
The weeks over which the festival is observed cycle at each site approximately once every 12 years 
based on the Hindu luni-solar calendar and the relative astrological positions of Jupiter, the sun and 
the moon. The gap between Prayag and Haridwar festivals is about 6 years, and both feature a Maha(full) 
& Ardha(half) Kumbh Melas.The Kumbh Melas have three dates around which the significant majority 
of pilgrims participate, while the festival itself lasts between one to three months around these dates.
Each festival attracts millions, with the largest gathering at the Prayag Kumbh Mela and the second
 largest at Haridwar.According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 60 million Hindus gathered for 
the Kumbh Mela in 2001.The festival is one of the largest peaceful gatherings in the world, and 
considered as the "world's largest congregation of religious pilgrims".It has been inscribed on 
the UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.The festival is 
observed over many days, with the day of Amavasya attracting the largest number on a single day. 
The Kumbh Mela authorities said that the largest one-day attendance at the Kumbh Mela was 30 million 
on 10 February 2013 and 50 million on 4 February 2019.
