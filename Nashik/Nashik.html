                    History:
                    In the 18th century, the present-day Nashik district was part of the Maratha Confederacy, 
                    within the territory controlled directly by the Maratha Peshwa. The district contains several 
                    old hill forts, the scenes of many engagements during the Anglo-Maratha Wars. 
                    The district became British territory in 1818 on the overthrow of the Peshwa. 
                    The present-day district was initially divided between Kandesh and Ahmadnagar 
                    districts of Bombay Presidency, a province of British India. Nashik district was 
                    created in 1869. The population in 1901 was 816,504, showing a decrease of 
                    3% in the decade 1891â€“1901. The principal crops were millet, wheat, pulse, 
                    oil-seeds, cotton and sugar cane. There were also some vineyards, and 
                    much garden cultivation. Yeola was an important centre for weaving silk and
                     cotton goods. There were flour-mills at Malegaon, railway workshops at
                     Manmad and Igatpuri, and cantonments at Deolali and Malegaon.

                    Missionary Society, founded in 1854. In 1861 the main northeast line of the 
                    Great Indian Peninsula Railway was completed across the district, and in 
                    1878 a chord line was completed between Manmad, on the northeast line 
                    in Nashik district, and Daund, on the southeast line in Pune district. 
                    From India's independence in 1947 up to 1960, Nashik district was part 
                    of Bombay State, which split into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
